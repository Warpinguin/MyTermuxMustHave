# MyTermuxMustHave
My try for making basic termux "setup" as basic as it could be, but have all "must have" pkgs.
I did it for myself coz i srew a lot so many times . . .
And i just hate the proces of preparing termux again from 0 to some basic usefull point.
But if it gonna be usefull for any1 else Ill be just glad :)

For use wrote this commands one (line) by one (line) :

 pkg update && pkg upgrade -y (opinionaly then y for yes and then i for instal)

 pkg install git

 git clone https://github.com/Warpinguin/MyTermuxMustHave

 cd MyTermuxMustHave

 chmod +x my_script.sh

 ./my_script.sh
